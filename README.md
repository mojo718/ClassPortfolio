# Challenge 2 Project - My Portfolio

Description

My first attempt to build a webapp from scratch.  It is a portfolio page with menu links to different sections of the page


Prerequistes
Any Web Browser

Getting Started:
Clone the repository from https://github.com/mojo718/ClassPortfolio
Open Index.html in browser to view site
Open Index.html and style.css in you favorite code editor to review code

Note: Not quite what i envisioned.  Needed more time to figure out how to get images in my FlexBoxes and to get them to scale with page. I will keep practicing and working on this page.

Thanks for your help and resources.
